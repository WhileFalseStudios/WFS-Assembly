# WFS-Assembly
> An interpreted assembly language library for .NET 3.5+

An experimental library for running interpreted assembly code. The entire thing was written in a week, and only supports a small subset of most assembly languages.

## Supported Instructions
The library currently does not support every possible instruction in every possible assembly dialect. The existing instructions are most significantly influenced by x86, but its not 1:1.

TODO: list them here.

## Projects
- WFS.Assembly: the actual library. Builds as a DLL.
- AssemblyTester: a small program to test the features.

## License
There's no specific license, just don't use it commercially and be sure to let us know if you end up using it for something.
